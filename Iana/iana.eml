Media type name: application
Media subtype name: json-nd

Required parameters: There are no required parameters

Optional parameters:
The following parameters are optional
version
style


Encoding considerations: 8bit
The standard encoding format is UTF-8 (as per standard practice in application/json mimetype

Security considerations:
application/json-nd is syntactically identical to application/json and will inherit all the security considerations of application/json.  The semantics of the JSON-ND specification will allow a for the definition of Remote Procedure Calls,  but does not specifically implement them. However there are potential security implication for dynamically generated function calls generated by a bad actor (in particular denial of service attack) based upon the content of a JSON-ND specification. This should be considered identical to the security implications of JSON-Schema Defintions, WADL, and WSDL specifications.

Interoperability considerations:
The media type is intended to interoperate across as many systems and applications as possible

Published specification:
Draft Specification
https://github.com/glenkleidon/JSON-ND/releases/download/V_0.1-Discussion/README.pdf

See also https://github.com/glenkleidon/JSON-ND and select "branches" for work in progress

Applications which use this media:
Any application needing to interoperate with another system may use this message syntax. As JSON-ND is syntactically identical to JSON syntax, any application currently using JSON syntax may use alternatively use JSON-ND.

Fragment identifier considerations:
none

Restrictions on usage:
none

Provisional registration? (standards tree only):
none

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: none 2. Magic number(s): none 3. File extension(s): .jsonnd 4. Macintosh file type code: none 5. Object Identifiers: none

General Comments:
This request is intended to be a provisional request in order to reserve the mime-type for the JSON-ND IETF RFC, currently in early draft.   
The current master branch of the repository is a general discussion on which the draft specification will be based. Branches of this github repository will contain further refinement and eventually draft specifications.

Person to contact for further information:

1. Name: Glen Kleidon
2. Email: 

Intended usage: Common
The mime type application/json-nd is intended to be a semantic imposition on the existing "ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Syntax" and will use JSON syntax to encode additional data-type information for JSON values
